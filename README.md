# Clean Energy Sources in Switzerland

## Project Objective
This project aims to analyze and visualize data on renewable power plants in Switzerland to identify the canton with the most concentrated clean energy sources. The dataset used is from the Open Power System Data (OPSD) platform, which provides information on power sources operating in each canton, categorized into bioenergy, hydro, solar, or wind.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The dataset was first imported and preprocessed to ensure consistency and remove any missing or erroneous values. This involved data type conversion, handling missing values, and standardizing naming conventions.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
1. Calculating Total Energy Production: The total energy production from each type of clean energy source (bioenergy, hydro, solar, wind) was calculated for each canton.

2. Creating a Bar Chart: A bar chart was created to visualize the total energy production from clean energy sources per canton. This provides a clear overview of the top cantons in terms of clean energy production.

3. Creating an Interactive Map: An interactive map of Switzerland was created using Plotly's choropleth feature. The map displays the number of clean energy sources operating in each canton, providing a geographic representation of the distribution of clean energy sources.

### Streamlit App
To enhance the accessibility and interactiveness of the analysis, a Streamlit app was developed. The app presents the bar chart and interactive map, allowing users to explore the data and gain insights into the distribution of clean energy sources in Switzerland.

## Conclusion
The findings of this project demonstrate that Switzerland is making significant progress in expanding clean energy sources. The canton of Valais emerges as the leader in clean energy production, followed closely by Bern and Graub√ºnden. The interactive visualizations provide a compelling way to visualize and analyze the data, fostering a deeper understanding of the clean energy landscape in Switzerland.
